# social-network-api
## Description 
The Social Network API is a back-end application that provides a foundation for building a social network web application. It allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, create a friend list, and manage interactions within the network. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose ODM for database interactions.

This project is a part of a larger full-stack application that demonstrates the usage of various technologies commonly found in social networking platforms. It provides API routes to manage users, thoughts, reactions, and friend relationships.
